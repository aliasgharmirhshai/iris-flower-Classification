# Flower Classification Project

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to classify flowers into different species based on their physical measurements. The dataset used is the popular Iris dataset, which includes various attributes of iris flowers such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

In this file, I have manually rewritten some of the data preparation and modeling processes without using any specific libraries.
